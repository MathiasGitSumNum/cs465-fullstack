CS-465 Full Stack Development with MEAN

Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).

  The front end code can be found throughout the full stack project because the app is client facing. Java is on the front and back ends which makes this webpage function dynamically. This can be used to pull information from the MongoDB website and can help to make the page user friendly.

Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?

  The backend used a NoSQL MongoDB database because of how easily it can be to change the scaling and functionality of the app. It can also horizontally change the scale quickly and efficiently due to that relation to the database.

How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?

  JSON can format object data and is generally easy to read with Java. JavaScript will take the data and turn it into an object in the Java language. This helps to connect the frontend to the backend development processes. 

Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.

  Looking over the websites address and checking to see if it loads successfully or produces any errors is step one. Methods like GET, POST, and PUT are all http requests and can be used to review or edit the database. The backend allows this by using the database functions such as .create, .findOne, and .findOneAndUpdate in order to change the database according to the clientâ€™s needs. Endpoints need tested often so they function properly. Security is the last layer that is added to prevent unauthorized or unauthenticated users from accessing or editing the database.

How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?

  I'm unclear how exactly this course will help me with my professional goals. I think that everything learned in this course is still beneficial for landing a job in the future. I think the most interesting thing was seeing how the different code languages interact together in the project, as well as how customizable it all truly is.
